📑 Global Food Price Volatility Forecast (2001–2030)Project OverviewThis project provides a comprehensive time-series analysis and forecasting application for Global Food Price Inflation from 2001 through 2030.The core finding is that global food security has entered a new era of permanently elevated inflation (stabilizing near $9.7\%$ , $10\%$ through 2030), primarily driven by structural external shocks. The analysis clearly distinguishes between predictable structural risk and unpredictable domestic volatility.
🛠️ Methodology and Core Technology
The forecasting engine utilizes a robust Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) model.

💡 Key Analytical Findings
1. The New Global Baseline is $10\%$Analysis confirms that the Post-2020 Shocks permanently altered the global average inflation rate. The new equilibrium is forecasted to be $\mathbf{10\%}$, preventing a return to the historic $\approx 4.5\%$ baseline.
2. Volatility is Local, Not GlobalCorrelation analysis between structurally stable and highly volatile economies demonstrated a coefficient near zero.
   Conclusion: Food price volatility in high-risk states is overwhelmingly driven by local, domestic factors (e.g., currency devaluation, internal policy), not           passively imported from global markets.

3. Model Validation & Structural Limits
Model performance comparison established the framework's reliability and its key limitation:
